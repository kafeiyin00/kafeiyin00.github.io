I got my PhD degree in Photogrametry and Remote sensing from [LIESMARS](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en/), Wuhan University in 2021,  supervised by [Prof. Bisheng Yang](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/enbisheng-yang/).  I am interested in the hardware integration and data fusion of multi-platform mobile sensing&mapping systems.
